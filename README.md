**Instructions to run the code**

As the data is huge it will take more than 10 hours to generate a word Tfidf and Bigram Tfidf by running preprocess.py and to collect data from api it will take more than 6 hours by running the datacollection.py. 

So, to save that time import the collections from cnndata folder into mongodb database name CNNProxy.

Cnn folder can be downloaded from the below link.
